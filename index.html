                <p>I just finished watching Big Hero 6 for the hundredth time, and I just have to gush about it. Seriously, this movie is sooo much fun and super interesting! From the get-go, it pulls you into this incredible world of San Fransokyo, and the animation is just mind-blowing.</p>
                <p>Now, let's talk about Baymax. OMG, Baymax is the cutest and funniest! I mean, who wouldn’t want a huggable, inflatable robot following them around and making sure they’re okay? His "Ba-la-la-la-la" fist bump and his obsession with making sure everyone is healthy just cracked me up every single time. Plus, his waddle? Adorable overload!<picture>

                  </picture></p>
                <p>But, can we take a moment of silence for Tadashi? <picture>
                    <source srcset="https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/latest/1f494/512.webp" type="image/webp">
                    <img src="https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/latest/1f494/512.gif" alt="💔" width="20" height="20">
                  </picture> I seriously can't get over the fact that he had to die. Like, WHY?! He was so hot and such an amazing big brother. I still think about how different things could've been if he had stayed around. Ugh, it’s so unfair. Hiro definitely deserved more time with him, and let's be real, we all wanted more screen time with Tadashi.</p>
                <p>Overall, Big Hero 6 is just one of those movies that you can watch over and over and never get tired of. It’s got everything: action, humor, heart, and a pinch of heartbreak. If you haven’t seen it yet, what are you even doing with your life? Go watch it now!</p>
                <p>Stay interesting!<picture>

                  </picture></p>
                <p>I just rewatched Moana, and I’m feeling all the feels right now<picture>
                    <source srcset="https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/latest/1f979/512.webp" type="image/webp">
                    <img src="https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/latest/1f979/512.gif" alt="🥹" width="20" height="20">
                  </picture>. This movie is so comforting and reminds me so much of home. Living on an island, I really relate to Moana's connection to the ocean and her desire to explore beyond the horizon<picture>
                    <source srcset="https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/latest/1f305/512.webp" type="image/webp">
                    <img src="https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/latest/1f305/512.gif" alt="🌅" width="20" height="20">
                  </picture>. It makes me miss the beach and those crystal-clear waters that I grew up with. Seriously, there’s nothing like the view of the ocean stretching out endlessly, right?</p>
                <p>Watching Moana also made me crave the seafood from back home<picture>
                    <source srcset="https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/latest/1f924/512.webp" type="image/webp">
                    <img src="https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/latest/1f924/512.gif" alt="🤤" width="20" height="20">
                  </picture>. The seafood here just doesn’t compare—it’s so expensive and not nearly as fresh. Back home, we have the freshest fish, shrimp, and crabs right at our fingertips, and it's super affordable. I miss those delicious seafood feasts with my family and friends by the beach. Ugh, now I’m hungry just thinking about it!</p>
                <p>Moana’s journey is so inspiring to me. Her bravery and willingness to take risks really hit home. She doesn’t let fear stop her from doing what she believes in, and that’s something I want to carry with me. It’s a reminder that even though I’m far from home, I can still be brave and take risks in my own life. Just like Moana found her way, I know I can navigate whatever comes my way too.</p>
                <p>So, if you haven’t seen Moana yet, what are you waiting for? It’s a beautiful movie with a powerful message that will make you laugh, cry, and maybe even sing along. And for those of us missing home, it’s a perfect way to feel connected to our roots and find some comfort!</p>
                <p>Stay adventurous!<picture>

                <p>I just watched Little Women again, and I can't get over how comforting and inspiring this movie is<picture>
                    <source srcset="https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/latest/2728/512.webp" type="image/webp">
                    <img src="https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/latest/2728/512.gif" alt="✨" width="20" height="20">
                  </picture> Every time I see it, it feels like wrapping myself in a warm blanket. The characters, their stories, and the beautiful setting all come together to create this amazing feeling of home and family. It's like a big hug in movie form, and I love every second of it.</p>
                <p>This movie really inspires me and has such a huge impact on my life. The way each of the March sisters follows their own path and stays true to themselves is just so empowering. They face so many challenges, but they never give up on their dreams. It's a great reminder that it's okay to be different and to have your own unique goals<picture>
                    <source srcset="https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/latest/1f917/512.webp" type="image/webp">
                    <img src="https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/latest/1f917/512.gif" alt="🤗" width="20" height="20">
                  </picture>. Watching them makes me want to be braver and more determined in pursuing my own dreams.</p>
                <p>One quote from the movie that I think about all the time is when Meg says, "Just because my dreams are different than yours, it doesn't mean they’re unimportant." This line really speaks to me because it's such a powerful message about respecting and valuing each other's dreams, no matter how different they might be. It's something I try to remember in my own life, especially when I'm feeling down or doubting myself.</p>
                <p>If you haven't seen Little Women yet, you absolutely have to! It's such a beautiful, heartwarming film that will leave you feeling inspired and ready to take on the world!</p>
                <p>Stay curious<picture>

                <p>I just watched All the Bright Places, and wow, what a rollercoaster of emotions!<picture>
                    <source srcset="https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/latest/1f3a2/512.webp" type="image/webp">
                    <img src="https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/latest/1f3a2/512.gif" alt="🎢" width="20" height="20">
                  </picture> This movie is both comforting and heart-wrenching at the same time. It’s like diving into a deep pool of feelings where you laugh one moment and cry the next. The adventurous spirit of Violet and Finch’s journey kept me on the edge of my seat throughout.</p>
                <p>The way this movie portrays grief and depression is so spot on<picture>
                    <source srcset="https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/latest/1f44f_1f3fb/512.webp" type="image/webp">

                  </picture>. It doesn’t shy away from the tough stuff—instead, it dives right into the messy, complicated emotions that come with loss and mental health struggles. It’s raw and real, and it made me think about my own experiences and those of my loved ones.</p>
                <p>Watching Violet and Finch’s relationship reminded me a lot of me and my boyfriend. We have our own ups and downs, just like they do. Seeing them navigate their feelings and support each other through tough times was really relatable. It’s a reminder that love isn’t always perfect, but it can be a source of strength and healing<picture>

                <p>If you’re looking for a movie that’s both fun and deep, All the Bright Places is definitely worth watching. Grab some tissues though—you’re gonna need them!<picture>

                  </picture>. This movie is like the perfect mix of cute and fun romantic comedy with a twist of heartbreak that hits you right in the gut. I mean, who doesn’t love a good love story, right?</p>
                <p>The chemistry between Louisa and Will is just adorable. Their banter and awkward moments had me laughing and swooning at the same time. It’s one of those movies where you find yourself rooting for the characters to end up together from the very beginning. Plus, the British charm and beautiful scenery add to the whole romantic vibe.</p>
                <p>But let’s talk about that ending—OMG, my heart!<picture>
                    <source srcset="https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/latest/2764_fe0f_200d_1fa79/512.webp" type="image/webp">

                  </picture> Without giving too much away, it’s one of those endings that leaves you reaching for the tissues. It’s bittersweet and makes you think about life and love in a whole new way. I won’t lie, I cried like a baby, but it’s a testament to how deeply this movie pulls you into the story.</p>
                <p>If you’re in the mood for a sweet romance with a touch of heartbreaking reality, Me Before You is definitely worth a watch. Just be prepared to ride an emotional rollercoaster!<picture>

                <p>Hi my lovelies!<picture>

                  </picture></p>
                <p>Just watched La La Land and OMG, it's like the cutest romantic comedy ever! First off, the whole musical vibe with Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone dancing and singing their hearts out? Adorable. It's like a modern-day fairy tale set in LA, where dreams are made and broken.</p>
                <p>Okay, so the story is about this jazz musician, Sebastian (played by Ryan Gosling, who's totally hot by the way<picture>
                    <source srcset="https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/latest/1f60b/512.webp" type="image/webp">
                    <img src="https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/latest/1f60b/512.gif" alt="😋" width="20" height="20">
                  </picture>), and this aspiring actress, Mia (Emma Stone, she's amazing too!). They meet and fall in love, but of course, life and their ambitions get in the way. The chemistry between them? Off the charts! You just root for them the whole time.</p>
                <p>But guys, let's talk about that ending. I won't spoil it, but let's just say it's a real tear-jerker<picture>
                    <source srcset="https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/latest/1f972/512.webp" type="image/webp">

                  </picture>. Like, my heart was totally shattered into a million pieces<picture>
                    <source srcset="https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/latest/2764_fe0f_200d_1fa79/512.webp" type="image/webp">

                  </picture>. It's one of those endings that makes you think about life and love and all that deep stuff. I'm still recovering from it, TBH.</p>
                <p>And can we give a shoutout to Ryan Gosling? He nailed it as Sebastian. The way he plays the piano and brings that passion for jazz to life? So. Freaking. Cool. He's not just a pretty face—he's got serious talent, and it shows in every scene.</p>
                <p>So yeah, if you're into romance, music, and a story that hits you right in the feels, La La Land is a must-watch. It's like a magical journey through LA with songs that'll be stuck in your head for days. Just have some tissues handy for that ending—you're gonna need 'em!<picture>

                <p>Just finished watching Howl's Moving Castle and I am totally swooning over it!<picture>

                  </picture> This movie is like a magical rollercoaster ride with twists and turns that keep you hooked from start to finish. First off, the animation and cinematography? Absolutely chef's kiss! Studio Ghibli really outdid themselves with this one—every frame is like a painting come to life.</p>
                <p>So, the story follows this girl, Sophie, who gets cursed by a witch and turns into an old lady (yep, things get real weird real fast). But then she ends up chilling in this moving castle owned by Howl, this super dreamy wizard who's kind of a drama queen<picture>
                    <source srcset="https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/latest/1f644/512.webp" type="image/webp">
                    <img src="https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/latest/1f644/512.gif" alt="🙄" width="20" height="20">
                  </picture>. Seriously, can I find myself a wizard in a moving castle too?</p>
                <p>Watching Howl's Moving Castle seriously makes me wanna go on an adventure like Sophie's. I mean, who wouldn't want to explore magical wastelands and get caught up in spells and flying battles? It's all so epic and makes you wish you could experience it for real.</p>
                <p>Fun fact: I’ve actually read the book too, and let me tell you, it’s quite different from the movie! Both are amazing in their own ways, but the movie definitely adds its own Studio Ghibli charm and flair. If you’re into fantasy, romance, and a bit of mystery, this movie is totally worth a watch.</p>
                <p>Magically yours, Belle.<picture>

                <p>So I just watched Spirited Away and OMG, it was such an epic adventure! Like, seriously, if you haven't seen it yet, you gotta add it to your watchlist ASAP. The whole story revolves around this girl, Chihiro, who ends up in this crazy spirit world after her parents kinda get turned into pigs<picture>
                    <source srcset="https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/latest/1f416/512.webp" type="image/webp">
                    <img src="https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/latest/1f416/512.gif" alt="🐖" width="20" height="20">
                  </picture> (yeah, it's wild).</p>
                <p>What I loved most about Spirited Away is how it blends this magical fantasy world with real-life lessons. Chihiro goes through all these challenges and meets these quirky spirits that are both hilarious and a little scary. It's like you're right there with her, feeling every emotion she feels. Plus, the animation is so stunning—every scene is like a work of art that sucks you in.</p>
                <p>After watching this movie, I seriously wish I could experience what Chihiro did. Imagine stumbling upon a bathhouse for spirits or helping out cute creatures like No-Face (who's kinda creepy but grows on you). It's that feeling of being transported to a place where anything can happen, and you're just along for the ride.</p>
                <p>And can we talk about the vibes? Spirited Away has this nostalgic, comfy feel that just wraps you up like a warm blanket. It's like revisiting childhood memories and discovering new wonders at the same time. Totally the kind of movie you wanna watch on a cozy weekend with hot cocoa<picture>
                    <source srcset="https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/latest/2615/512.webp" type="image/webp">

                  </picture>.</p>
                <p>So yeah, if you're into magical adventures that mix fun and feels, definitely give Spirited Away a watch. It's a total mood booster and will leave you daydreaming about what other fantastical worlds might be out there. Trust me, you won't regret it! <picture>

                <p>Hey there! I'm Jesabel Aurora James aka Belle for short, an average 21-year-old uni student. I come from a small town in Sabah and I'm currently studying Library Management in UiTM Puncak Perdana, Shah Alam.</p>
                <p>I absolutely love diving into different genres of movies, but adventure and romance movies hold a special place in my heart. When I'm not watching movies, you can find me reading novels, playing video games, cooking up new recipes in the kitchen, or travelling.</p>
                <p>Fun fact: I grew up watching all the classic Disney Movies and this really helped me expand my english vocabulary and improve my english pronunciation.</p>
